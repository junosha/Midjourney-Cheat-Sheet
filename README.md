# Midjourney-Cheat-Sheet

The “Midjourney Cheat Sheet” is a handy overview you can print out and put next to your workspace.

It should cover all the basic settings and prompt parameters, and even points out some advanced concepts.

Since Midjourney is constantly coming up with new features and additions, this overview is a "work in progress" and will be updated every few weeks. If you think something important is missing, please let me know via [Medium](tristwolff.medium.com) or [Twitter](twitter.com/tristwolff)🙏
